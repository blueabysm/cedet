(defvar semantic-toplevel-bovine-table nil
  "Variable that defines how to bovinate top level items in a buffer.
Set this in your major mode to return function and variable semantic
types.

The format of a BOVINE-TABLE is:

 ( ( NONTERMINAL-SYMBOL1 MATCH-LIST1 )
   ( NONTERMINAL-SYMBOL2 MATCH-LIST2 )
   ...
   ( NONTERMINAL-SYMBOLn MATCH-LISTn )
 
Where each NONTERMINAL-SYMBOL is an artificial symbol which can appear
in any child state.  As a starting place, one of the NONTERMINAL-SYMBOLS
must be `bovine-toplevel'.

A MATCH-LIST is a list of possible matches of the form:

 ( STATE-LIST1
   STATE-LIST2
   ...
   STATE-LISTN )

where STATE-LIST is of the form:
  ( TYPE1 [ \"VALUE1\" ] TYPE2 [ \"VALUE2\" ] ... LAMBDA )

where TYPE is one of the returned types of the token stream.
VALUE is a value, or range of values to match against.  For
example, a SYMBOL might need to match \"foo\".  Some TYPES will not
have matching criteria.

LAMBDA is a lambda expression which is evaled with the text of the
type when it is found.  It is passed the list of all buffer text
elements found since the last lambda expression.  It should return a
semantic element (see below.)

You can easily avoid learning the format of this variable by
writing a BNF file.  See notes in `semantic-bnf.el' or the
\"BNF conversion\" section in the semantic texinfo manual.

For consistency between languages, try to use common return values
from your parser.  Please reference the \"Semantic Token Style Guide\"
section in the semantic texinfo manual.")
