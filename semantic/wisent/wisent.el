;; Parser engine and runtime of Wisent.

;; Wisent (the European Bison ;-) is an Elisp implementation of the
;; GNU Compiler Compiler Bison.  The Elisp code is a port of the C
;; code of GNU Bison 1.28 & 1.31.
;;
;; For more details on the basic concepts for understanding Wisent,
;; read the Bison manual ;)
;;
;; For more details on Wisent itself read the Wisent manual.
