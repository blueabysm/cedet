"Return the next available lexical token.

Eat syntactic tokens produced by `semantic-flex', available in
variable `wisent-flex-istream', and return Wisent's lexical tokens.

See documentation of `semantic-flex-tokens' for details on the
syntactic tokens returned by `semantic-flex'.

In most cases one syntactic token is mapped to one lexical token.  But
in certain cases several successive syntactic tokens can be mapped to
one lexical tokens.  A common case is given by arithmetic operators
which can be made of multiple punctuations.

Also the mapping between syntactic tokens and lexical ones uses regexp
match by default, but can use string comparison too.

The rules specifying how to do the mapping are defined in two symbol
tables:

  - The keyword table in variable `semantic-flex-keywords-obarray';

  - The token table in variable `wisent-flex-tokens-obarray'.

Keywords are directly mapped to equivalent Wisent's lexical tokens
like this (SF- prefix means `semantic-flex', WF- `wisent-flex'):

  (SF-KEYWORD start . end)  ->  (WF-KEYWORD \"name\" start . end)

Mapping of other tokens obeys to rules in the token table.  Here is an
example on how to define the mapping of 'punctuation syntactic tokens.

1. Add (`intern') the symbol 'punctuation into the token table.

2. Set its value to the mapping rules to use.  Mapping rules are an
   alist of (WF-TOKEN . MATCHER) elements.  WF-TOKEN is the category
   of the Wisent's lexical token (for example 'OPERATOR).  MATCHER is
   the regular expression used to filter input data (for example
   \"[+-]\").  The first element of the mapping rule alist defines a
   default matching rule. It must be nil or have the form (WF-TOKEN).
   When there is no mapping rule that matches the syntactic token
   value, the default WF-TOKEN or nil is returned.

   Thus, if the syntactic token symbol 'punctuation has the mapping
   rules '(nil (OPERATOR . \"[+-]\")), the following token:

   (punctuation 1 . 2)

   will be mapped to the lexical token

   (OPERATOR \"+\" 1 . 2)

   if the buffer contained \"+\" between positions 1 and 2.

   To define multiple matchers for the same WF-TOKEN just give
   several (WF-TOKEN . MATCHER) values.  MATCHERs will be tried in
   sequence until one matches.

3. Optionally customize how `wisent-flex' will interpret mapping
   rules, using symbol properties.

   The following properties are recognized:

   'string
     If non-nil MATCHERs are interpreted as strings instead of
     regexps, and matching uses direct string comparison.  This could
     speed up things in certain cases.

   'multiple
     non-nil indicates to lookup at multiple successive syntactic
     tokens and try to match the longest one.

   'char-literal
     non-nil indicates to return the first character of the syntactic
     token value as the lexical token category.  It is the default for
     punctuation, open-paren and close-paren syntactic tokens.  Use
     this property when grammar contains references to character
     literals.

   'handler
     If non-nil must specify a function with no argument that will be
     called first to map the syntactic token.  It must return a
     lexical token or nil, and update the input stream in variable
     `wisent-flex-istream' accordingly.

   The following example maps multiple punctuations to operators and
   use string comparison:

   (let ((entry (intern 'punctuation token-table)))
     (set entry '(nil ;; No default mapping
                  (LSHIFT . \"<<\") (RSHIFT . \">>\")
                  (LT     .  \"<\") (GT     .  \">\")))
     (put entry 'string   t)
     (put entry 'multiple t))"
