The end result of a @semantic{} parser is a list of tags per each buffer.
This chapter discusses the tag data structure and the API provided
by @semantic{} to query, process, and modify tags.

The tags list for a buffer can be obtained by calling
@code{semantic-bovinate-toplevel} which returns
a parse tree of tags that represent the program structure.

@ignore
David said:

Tags are not sorted.  Maybe would it be clearer to say that
`semantic-bovinate-toplevel' returns a parse tree of tags that
represent the program structure.

From a grammar's developer point of view it could be worth
highlighting that the parse tree of tags should be consistent with
buffer's location.

For example, for the following definition:

(defun foo (x y) ...)

The parse tree should look like:

("foo" function
 (:arguments
  ("x" "y"))
  ...)

A bad parse tree is for example:

("foo" function
 (:arguments
  ("y" "x"))   <--- Arguments are in the reverse order
  ...)

@node Tag Basics
@section Tag Basics
@cindex Tag Basics

Currently each tag is a list with up to five elements:
@example
("NAME" CLASS ATTRIBUTES PROPERTIES OVERLAY)
@end example

Application developers should not rely on this list structure.
Instead they should rely on the provided API documented in this chapter.
The list structure is explained here primarily to help those reading
the @semantic{} source code.

@itemize @bullet
@c
@item @var{NAME} is a required component for all tags, i.e., every tag
must have this component. It is also guaranteed to be a string.  This
string represents the name of the tag, usually a named definition
which the language will use elsewhere as a reference to the syntactic
element found.
@c
@item @var{CLASS} is the other required component for all tags.
It is a symbol representing the class of the tag.
@ignore
David said:
I think it would be better to say the category or class of tag
[rather than ``type''].  Type of tag could be confusing.  The notion
of tag type represents program data type (see the function
`semantic-tag-type').
@end ignore
Valid @var{CLASS}s can be anything, as long is it is an Emacs Lisp
symbol.  However following are some of the well-known symbols:
@var{type}, @var{function}, @var{variable}, @var{include},
@var{package}, @var{code}.
@c
@item @var{ATTRIBUTES} is a property list that keep information related
to the tag parsed from the buffer.
@ignore

It could be worth enumerating the commonly used attribute names:

  :type
  :members
  :superclasses
  :interfaces
  :default-value
  :documentation
  :arguments
  :system-flag
  :detail

We could recommend to use the above names when that makes sense, and
more generally to use the Emacs keyword notation (symbol starting with
':') for attribute names.
@end ignore
@c
@item @var{PROPERTIES} is generated by the semantic parser harness,
and need not be provided by a language author.
@c
@item @var{OVERLAY} represents positional information for this tag.  It is
automatically generated by the semantic parser harness, and need
not be provided by the language author.
@c Below is from old semantic manual: unless they provide a
@c nonterminal expansion function via
@c @code{semantic-expand-nonterminal}.
Depending on the overlay in a program can be dangerous because
sometimes the overlay is replaced with an integer pair
@example
[ START END ]
@end example
when the buffer the tag belongs to is not in memory.  This happens
when a using has activated the Semantic Database
 @inforef{semanticdb, , lang-support-guide}.
@c
@end itemize

@defun semantic-tag-name tag
Return the name of @var{TAG}, i.e., a string.
For functions, variables, classes, typedefs, etc., this is the identifier
that is being defined.  For tags without an obvious associated name, this
may be the statement type, e.g., this may return `print' for python's
print statement.
@obsolete{semantic-token-name,semantic-tag-name}
@end defun

@defun semantic-tag-class tag
Return the class of @var{TAG}.
That is, the symbol @code{'variable}, @code{'function}, @code{'type}, or other.
@c Where can the reader find complete list of classes? -ryk8/13/03.
@obsolete{semantic-token-token,semantic-tag-class}
@end defun

Several functions that deal with @var{ATTRIBUTES} component are given
in @ref{Tag Attributes Internals,Tag Attributes Internals}.
However functions listed in @ref{Tag Query,Tag Query}
should provide most needs of the application developer.

Similarly functions that deal with @var{PROPERTIES} component are given
in @ref{Tag Properties Internals,Tag Properties Internals}.
The application developer should not need to use any of these.

Finally @ref{Tag Overlay,Tag Overlay} lists functions dealing with
the @var{OVERLAY} component.

@node Tag Overlay
@section Tag Overlay

Note for language authors:
  If a mode defines a language tag that has tags in it with overlays
you should still return them with this function.
Ignoring this step will prevent several features from working correctly.
@end defun

@defun semantic-tag-components-with-overlays-default tag

Children are any sub-tags which contain overlays.
The default action collects regular components of @var{TAG}, in addition

@node Tag Hooks
@section Tag Hooks
@cindex Tag Hooks

Individual tags can have hooks associated with them.  Hooks are saved
as properties, but can cause specific tags to have special behaviors
after a hook is added.

You can manipulate tag hooks with these functions:

@defun semantic-tag-add-hook tag hook value &optional append
Add onto @var{TAG} a @var{HOOK} with @var{VALUE}.
@end defun

@defun semantic-tag-remove-hook tag hook value
Remove from @var{TAG} the @var{HOOK} with @var{VALUE}.
@end defun

For a developer, if you have an application for which you want to
support a special kind of hook on a per tag basis, you can use this
to run those hooks.

@defun semantic--tag-run-hooks tag hook &rest args
Run for @var{TAG} all expressions saved on the property @var{HOOK}.
Each hook expression must take at least one argument, the @var{TAG}.
For any given situation, additional @var{ARGS} may be passed.
@end defun

Semantic supports two TAG specific hooks at this time:

@table @code
@item link-hook
This hook is run whenever a tag is linked into a buffer.  This occurs
just after parsing, and whenever a tag is loaded into memory.  This
hook also executes after a datase save, when all tags are first
unlinked from the current buffer before the save.
@item unlink-hook
This hook is run whenever a tag is unlinked from a buffer.  This
ocucrs during a database save, or when a tag is modified by the
incremental parser.
@end table

@end defun

@defun semantic--tag-expanded-p tag
Return non-@code{nil} if @var{TAG} is expanded.
This function is for internal use only.
See also the function @code{semantic--expand-tag}.
@end defun

@defun semantic--tag-expand tag
Convert @var{TAG} from a raw state to a cooked state, and expand it.
Returns a list of cooked tags.

  The parser returns raw tags with positional data @var{START} @var{END} at the
end of the tag data structure (a list for now).  We convert it from
that to a cooked state that uses an overlay proxy, that is, a vector
[@var{START} @var{END}].

  The raw tag is changed with side effects and maybe expanded in
several derived tags when the variable @code{semantic-tag-expand-function}
is set.

This function is for internal use only.

I was curious as to what semantic functions were called by a real
semantic application such as ECB.  So I searched ECB and listed all
functions that ECB calls that start with ``semantic-''.  Then as I
document one by one, I deleted them.  The functions below are ones
that I have not yet gone through. -ryk8/13/03.
