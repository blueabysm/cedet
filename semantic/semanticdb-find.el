;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Databases of various forms can all be searched.
;; There are a few types of searches that can be done:
;;
;;   Basic Name Search:
;;    These searches scan a database table  collection for tags based
;;    on name.
;;
;;   Basic Brute Search:
;;    These searches allow searching on specific attributes of tags,
;;    such as name, type, or other attribute.
;;
;;   Advanced Search:
;;    These are searches that were needed to accomplish some
;;    specialized tasks as discovered in utilities.  Advanced searches
;;    include matching methods defined outside some parent class.
;;
;;    The reason for advanced searches are so that external
;;    repositories such as the Emacs obarray, or java .class files can
;;    quickly answer these needed questions without dumping the entire
;;    symbol list into Emacs for a regular semanticdb search.
;;
;;   Generic Brute Search:
;;    The generic search, `semanticdb-find-nonterminal-by-function'
;;
;; How databases are decided upon is another important aspect of a
;; database search.  When it comes to searching for a name, there are
;; these types of searches:
;;
;;   Basic Search:
;;    Basic search means that tags looking for a given name start
;;    with a specific search path.  Names are sought on that path
;;    until it is empty or items on the path can no longer be found.
;;
;;   Brute Search:
;;    Brute search means that all tables in all databases in a given
;;    project are searched.  Brute searches are the search style as
;;    written for semantic version 1.x.
;;
;; How does the search path work?
;;
;;  A basic search starts with three parameters:
;;
;;     (FINDME &optional PATH FIND-FILE-MATCH)
;;
;;  FINDME is key to be searched for dependent on the type of search.
;;  PATH is an indicator of which tables are to be searched.
;;  FIND-FILE-MATCH indicates that any time a match is found, the
;;  file associated with the tag should be read into a file.
;;
;;  The PATH argument is then the most interesting argument.  It can
;;  have these values:
;;
;;    nil - Take the current buffer, and use it's include list
;;    buffer - Use that buffer's include list.
;;    filename - Use that file's include list.  If the file is not
;;        in a buffer, see of there is a semanticdb table for it.  If
;;        not, read that file into a buffer.
;;    tag - Get that tag's buffer of file file.  See above.
;;    table - Search that table, and it's include list.
;;
;; Application:
;;
;; Here are applications where different searches are needed which
;; exist as of semantic 1.4.x
;;
;; eldoc - popup help
;;   => Requires basic search using default path.  (Header files ok)
;; tag jump - jump to a named tag
;;   => Requires a brute search useing whole project. (Source files only)
;; completion - Completing symbol names in a smart way
;;   => Basic search (headers ok)
;; type analysis - finding type definitions for variables & fcns
;;   => Basic search (headers ok)
;; Class browser - organize types into some structure
;;   => Brute search, or custom navigation.

;; TODO:
;;  During a search, load any unloaded DB files based on paths in the
;;  current project.

(define-overload semanticdb-find-translate-path (path brutish)
  "Translate PATH into a list of semantic tables.
Path translation involves identifying the PATH input argument
in one of the following ways:
 nil - Take the current buffer, and use it's include list
 buffer - Use that buffer's include list.
 filename - Use that file's include list.  If the file is not
     in a buffer, see of there is a semanticdb table for it.  If
     not, read that file into a buffer.
 tag - Get that tag's buffer of file file.  See above.
 table - Search that table, and it's include list.
In addition, once the base path is found, there is the possibility of
each added table adding yet more tables to the path, so this routine
can return a lengthy list.
If argument BRUTISH is non-nil, then instead of using the include
list, use all tables found in the parent project of the table
identified by translating PATH.  Such searches use brute force to
scan every available table.
This routine uses `semanticdb-find-table-for-include' to translate
specific include tags into a semanticdb table."
