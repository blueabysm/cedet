;; In semantic 1.x, the lexical analyzer was an all purpose routine.
;; To boost efficiency, the analyzer is now a series of routines that
;; are constructed at build time into a single routine.  This will

  "An alist of of semantic token types.
As of December 2001 (semantic 1.4beta13), this variable is not used in
any code.  The only use is to refer to the doc-string from elsewhere.

The key to this alist is the symbol representing token type that
\\[semantic-flex] returns.  These are

  - bol:           Empty string matching a beginning of line.
                   This token is produced with
                   `semantic-lex-beginning-of-line'.

  - charquote:     String sequences that match `\\s\\+' regexp.
                   This token is produced with `semantic-lex-charquote'.

  - close-paren:   Characters that match `\\s)' regexp.
                   These are typically `)', `}', `]', etc.
                   This token is produced with
                   `semantic-lex-close-paren'.

  - comment:       A comment chunk.  These token types are not
                   produced by default.
                   This token is produced with `semantic-lex-comments'.
                   Comments are ignored with `semantic-lex-ignore-comments'.
                   Comments are treated as whitespace with
                   `semantic-lex-comments-as-whitespace'.

  - newline        Characters matching `\\s-*\\(\n\\|\\s>\\)' regexp.
                   This token is produced with `semantic-lex-newline'.

  - open-paren:    Characters that match `\\s(' regexp.
                   These are typically `(', `{', `[', etc.
                   If `semantic-lex-paren-or-list' is used,
                   then `open-paren' is not usually generated unless
                   the `depth' argument to \\[semantic-lex] is
                   greater than 0.
                   This token is always produced if the analyzer
                   `semantic-lex-open-paren' is used.

  - punctuation:   Characters matching `{\\(\\s.\\|\\s$\\|\\s'\\)'
                   regexp.
                   This token is produced with `semantic-lex-punctuation'.
                   Always specify this analyzer after the comment
                   analyzer.

  - semantic-list: String delimited by matching parenthesis, braces,
                   etc.  that the lexer skipped over, because the
                   `depth' parameter to \\[semantic-flex] was not high
                   enough.
                   This token is produced with `semantic-lex-paren-or-list'.

  - string:        Quoted strings, i.e., string sequences that start
                   and end with characters matching `\\s\"'
                   regexp.  The lexer relies on @code{forward-sexp} to
                   find the matching end.
                   This token is produced with `semantic-lex-string'.

  - symbol:        String sequences that match `\\(\\sw\\|\\s_\\)+'
                   regexp.
                   This token is produced with
                   `semantic-lex-symbol-or-keyword'.  Always add this analyzer
                   after `semantic-lex-number', or other analyzers that
                   match its regular expression.

  - whitespace:    Characters that match `\\s-+' regexp.
                   This token is produced with `semantic-lex-whitespace'.")
