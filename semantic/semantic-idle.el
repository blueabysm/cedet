;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Originally, `semantic-auto-parse-mode' handled refreshing the
;; tags in a buffer in idle time.  Other activities can be scheduled
;; in idle time, all of which require up-to-date tag tables.
;; Having a specialized idle time scheduler that first refreshes
;; the tags buffer, and then enables other idle time tasks reduces
;; the amount of work needed.  Any specialized idle tasks need not
;; ask for a fresh tags list.
