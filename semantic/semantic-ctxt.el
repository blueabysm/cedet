;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Semantic, as a tool, provides a nice list of searchable tokens.
;; That information can provide some very accurate answers if the current
;; context of a position is known.
;;
;; This library provides the hooks needed for a language to specify how
;; the current context is calculated.
