;;; Commentary:
;;
;; A majority of Java's useful functionality is inside class files.
;; Often these class files do not have parsable source available.  In
;; order to get full advantage of speedbar extensions, access to
;; these class files is needed.
;;
;; The `semantic-project-database-java' class inherits from the
;; the database base class.  It uses the JDEE BeanShell installation to
;; query the class files, and create token compatible with Semantic.
