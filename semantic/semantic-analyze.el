;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Semantic, as a tool, provides a nice list of searchable tags.
;; That information can provide some very accurate answers if the current
;; context of a position is known.
;;
;; Semantic-ctxt provides ways of analyzing, and manipulating the
;; semantic context of a language in code.
;;
;; This library provides routines for finding intelligent answers to
;; tough problems, such as if an argument to a function has the correct
;; return type, or all possible tags that fit in a given local context.

  "Return a list of semantic tags which are possible completions.
CONTEXT is either a position (such as point), or a precalculated
context.  Passing in a context is useful if the caller also needs
to access parts of the analysis.
Completions run through the following filters:
  * Elements currently in scope
  * Constants currently in scope
  * Elements match the :prefix in the CONTEXT.
  * Type of the completion matches the type of the context.
Context type matching can identify the following:
  * No specific type
  * Assignment into a variable of some type.
  * Argument to a function with type constraints.
When called interactively, displays the list of possible completions
in a buffer."
