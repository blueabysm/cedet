;; Filter symbol reference hits for accuracy.
;;
;; Most symbol referencing tools, such as find/grep only find matching
;; strings, but cannot determine the difference between an actual use,
;; and something else with a similar name, or even a string in a comment.
;;
;; This file provides utilities for filtering down to accurate matches
;; starting at a basic filter level that doesn't use symref, up to filters
;; across symref results.
