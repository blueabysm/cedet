;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file provides a top level integration test harness for
;; the various CEDET tools to do a simple stand-alone test.
;;
;; The below listed parts DO NOT happen in this order as various
;; tools have to work together to build up the project.
;;
;; Parts:
;;
;; 1) Create an EDE project in /tmp
;;    a build directory tree
;;    b make a toplevel project
;;    c Make a src and include directory
;;    d Put C++ src files into the correct directory.
;;    e Tell EDE where they are.
;;    f create a build file.
;;    g build the sources
;;
;; 2) Build sources using SRecode.
;;    a Fill in the constructed C files with classes and methods.
;;    b Test various templates
;;    c Use a template to build some C++ templates
;;    d SRecode to load the new template and construct some sources.
;;
;; 5) Semantic to parse stuff
;;    a Parse the sources
;;    b Use srecode to make more sources
;;    c test the incremental parsers.
;;    d test the completion engine.
;;    e Save semanticdb tables.  Are the files there?
;;
;; 6) Delete the project
;;    a Make sure the semanticdb cleans up the dead cache files.
;;    b Make sure EDE clears this project from it's project cache.
