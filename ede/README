EDE - Emacs Development Environment

Compiling instructions:

EDE depends on both EIEIO and SPEEDBAR while compiling.  As such, the
makefile included may not work if they are not in site-lisp, or other
system install area.

You can fetch the latest SPEEDBAR here (Version 0.8.1 or better):

http://www.ultranet.com/~zappo/speedbar.shtml

You can fetch the latest EIEIO here (Version 0.11 or better):

http://www.ultranet.com/~zappo/eieio.shtml

Once unpacked, you will need to tweek the Makefile to change the
LOADPATH variable to be correct for your situation.

To use the Web Site management features, local file names are needed
for copying distribution, and web pages.  You can use ange-ftp or EFS
for accessing FTP sites.  If some locations are accessible only
through scp, or rcp, you can use TRAMP to copy files.
