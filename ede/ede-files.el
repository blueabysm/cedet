;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Directory and File scanning and matching functions.
;;
;; Basic Model:
;;
;; A directory belongs to a project if a ede-project-autoload structure
;; matches your directory.
;;
;; A toplevel project is one where there is no active project above
;; it.  Finding the toplevel project involves going up a directory
;; till no ede-project-autoload structure matches.
