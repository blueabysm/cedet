;;; Commentary:
;;
;; pprint library provides a simple and flexible pretty-printer for
;; Elisp code.
;;
;; The core function `pprint-to-string' uses `prin1' to write into a
;; temporary buffer a "flat" representation of a given expression.
;; Then it walks over that linear form and inserts line breaks and
;; indentations to produce a pretty-printed representation of the
;; expression.
;;
;; The implementation uses a lot of inline functions to improve
;; performance.  And, when byte-compiled, pprint is reasonably fast.
;;
;; pprint can handle specific expressions using adapted "printers".  A
;; "printer" is a function that will be called to process a form that
;; match a regular expression.  A number of "standard printers" are
;; predefined to pretty print common Elisp statements like `defun',
;; `defvar', `lambda', `let', `progn', `cond', `if', etc..
;;
;; More "printers" should be provided in future versions ;-)
