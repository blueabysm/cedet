;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Keeping track of rapidly developing software is a tough thing to
;; do, expecially if you want to have co-dependent packages which all
;; move at different rates.
;;
;; This library provides a framework for specifying version numbers
;; and (as side effect) have a flexible way of getting a desired feature set.
;;
;; If you would like to use this package to satisfy dependenc replace this:
;; 
;; (require 'spiffy)
;;
;; with this:
;;
;; (require 'inversion)
;; (inversion-require 'spiffy "1.0")
;;
;; If you feel the need to not throw errors, you can do this instead:
;;
;; (let ((err (inversion-test 'spiffy "1.0")))
;;    (if err (your-stuff-here)))
;;
;; If you would like to make inversion optional, do this:
;;
;;(condition-case nil
;;    (require 'inversion)
;;  (error
;;   (defun inversion-test (p v)
;;     (string= v (symbol-value (intern-soft
;;			       (concat (symbol-string p) "-version")))))))
;;
;; Or modify to specify `inversion-require' instead.
;;
;; TODO:
;;  Offer to download newer versions of a package.
