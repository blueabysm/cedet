;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library automatically setups your [X]Emacs to use CEDET tools.
;;
;; First download the latest CEDET distribution, provided in a
;; cedet-<VERSION>.tar.gz tarball, from the project page at:
;; <http://sf.net/projects/cedet>.
;;  
;; Unpack the tarball in a directory of your choice.  It will install
;; the following directory tree:
;;
;;   cedet
;;     |
;;     +- common
;;     |
;;     +- cogre
;;     |
;;     +- ede
;;     |
;;     +- eieio
;;     |
;;     +- semantic
;;     |
;;     \- speedbar
;;
;; Then, add the following into your ~/.emacs startup file:
;;
;;   (load-file "<INSTALL-PATH>/cedet/common/cedet.el")
;;
;; If you want to turn on useful or all Semantic features by default,
;; respectively add:
;;
;;   (setq semantic-load-turn-useful-things-on t)
;; or
;;   (setq semantic-load-turn-everything-on t)
;;
;; before loading this file, like this:
;;
;;   (setq semantic-load-turn-useful-things-on t)
;;   (load-file "<INSTALL-PATH>/cedet/common/cedet.el")
;;
;; That's it!
